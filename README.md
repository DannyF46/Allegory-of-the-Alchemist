# Allegory of the Alchemist

"You are not born with knowledge of the world; you must bumble around in the dark for a while before you can learn to turn lead into gold."

You're locked up in a cave, and you can only perceive the outside world through shadows. Your shady friend needs your help: he comes to you with recipes and ingredients, but he doesn't know much about alchemy. It's up to you to identify which ingredients are the right one for their potion recipe.
